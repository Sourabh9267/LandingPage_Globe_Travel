## Landing Page Design - Code Implementation
###Overview
 I came across a landing page design template on Freepik that really caught my eye. Inspired by its clean and modern look, I decided to take on the challenge of transforming the design into code.

###What I Did

I used the design as a reference to create a landing page from scratch. After completing the development, I pushed the code to this GitHub repository for anyone interested in viewing or using it.

###What is expected

The very next thing i am looking forward to making it responsive for mobile devices.

###Technologies Used

,CSS
,JS
